# MONGO DAY

- DRAW A HIGHLEVEL SOCKET EVENT DIAGRAM
- as well as local only events.

- talk to db. update db record
- new entry schema / mechanism

- on the client side, is there a way to send an event on every x (5) keypresses , rather than on each one? 
maybe a For loop: i++, i hits 1 less than max, exec emit, then resets i to 0, auto repeats

ui fades in on mouse move ..
