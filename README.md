# Metome

## Ignore this repo for now plz.
A learning exercise to push a db entry down to the client (through JSON), and then updating the db upstream with changes made on the client. In real time, in the simplest most minimal way possible.

## uses as few dependencies as possible
- mongo
- node
- some npm modules
- few jquery bits

## Starting it up
	$ mongod
	$ node server.js
	http://localhost:3000/metome.html <-- this may change

and if you want to run queries:
	$ mongo

## JS styleguide and .jshintrc

	+ I need to make my own based on this and airbnb/artsy
