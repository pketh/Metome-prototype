# Metome Prototype
## Still in Progress! (formerly mongoland)
### Ignore this repo for now plz.
A learning exercise to push a db entry down to the client (through JSON), and then updating the db upstream with changes made on the client. Ideally in the simplest most minimal way possible.

- using mongo, node, client JS

# TODO
- move the dependencies to a package.json ...
- usage / how to run (basically, node server.js)
